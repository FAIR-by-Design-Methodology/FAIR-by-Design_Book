## Current Version: 1.5

## Version Date: 27-06-2024

> The initial version of this document has been developed based on the internal project-level feedback and the conducted public consultation.  Throughout the lifetime of the Skills4EOSC project, all additional feedback gathered from relevant internal and external stakeholders as well as training sessions on how to practically implement the proposed methodology is being used to further improve the methodology and its value to the EOSC training community. The continuous improvements are made in this open GitBook version of the methodology that is envisioned to be used as a supporting training material.
