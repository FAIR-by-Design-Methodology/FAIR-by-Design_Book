	abstract = {This case study focuses on the online training activities on Open Science delivered within the H2020 project Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration (TRIPLE, Grant Agreement 863420). The project is dedicated to building a discovery platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and is committed to promoting and supporting the uptake of Open Science within research practices.
            In order to address SSH research and training communities’ needs for enhanced competencies on Open Science and for stronger support in the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) management of digital training materials, two reusable outputs were produced. The work carried out is presented as a novel approach to tackle the issues related to FAIRifying research and training practices and to create training resources whose reusability and relevance reaches beyond the project lifetime and framework. The case study presents the methods by which the results were produced so as to encourage and enable their future adaptation and reuse.
            The TRIPLE Open Science training series (result 1) targets SSH researchers, research support personnel and infrastructure developers in need of practical tools and specific skills to integrate Open Science practices in their workflows. The training series provides 12 competence-oriented online training events in Open Access whose training materials are available as Open Educational Resources (OER).
            
              The TRIPLE Training Toolkit (result 2) targets training organisers and research performing organisations who wish to design and manage training events as OERs and increase the impact of their training following good practice. The Toolkit is an easily reproducible workflow designed to help trainers minimise the time they spend in managing training events following FAIR practice. The workflow follows a FAIR-by-design method to address the frequent findability and reusability issues related to the management of digital training resources

	abstract = {Abstract
            There is a wide range of activity in the higher education sector labelled ‘students as partners’ and ‘co-creation in learning and teaching’. Several frameworks have been proposed to map and categorise existing partnership and co-creation roles, activities, research, and practice. In this paper, I synthesise some of these frameworks to illustrate how the predominant focus in the international literature has been on partnership projects that select small groups of often already super-engaged or privileged students to participate. In contrast, co-creation in learning and teaching, embedded within the curriculum and involving a whole class of students, has been largely overlooked. I explore the potential of co-creating learning and teaching with a whole class of students (including face-to-face, blended, and online settings, and including lectures, tutorials, laboratories, and other methods of teaching); in other words, it is co-creation integral to students’ programmes and courses of study. I argue that whole-class approaches to co-creation may be inherently more inclusive of students than other approaches to co-creation and that this approach both relies upon, and contributes towards, building positive relationships between staff and students, and between students and students. I explore some of the challenges of whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching, and I also argue that the benefits suggest this is currently an underutilised and researched approach internationally.},

Including contributions from major international figures, the book contains a wealth of ideas and practical advice to help universities commit to quality in teaching and offers insights into how the topics raised can be directly applied. The book initially identifies some of the key issues surrounding the topic, such as the evidence-based identification of teaching quality; the training of university lecturers and faculty; external and internal quality assurance; the tension between professional autonomy and governmental regulation; and the involvement of students in developing quality. It then moves on to present ideas and initiatives to address these problems, tackling the subject through four sections: - Assuring Quality - questioning what quality assurance means and how it might be practised; - Identifying Quality - examining what knowledge exists at present and how it might be further researched; - Developing Quality - investigating the development of staff through teacher training and appraisal; - Case Studies of Quality Assurance - reviewing six case studies of quality assurance in a range of contrasting subjects including the professional subjects of Medicine, Nursing and Teacher Training which are also addressed systemically in the first section. Full of practical advice, Handbook of Quality Assurance for University Teaching is an invaluable and unique resource for Faculty, Subject Leaders, University Administrators and Quality Assessors"--},

A group of fourteen authors came together in February 2018 at the TIB (German National Library of Science and Technology) in Hannover to create an open, living handbook on Open Science training. High-quality trainings are fundamental when aiming at a cultural change towards the implementation of Open Science principles. Teaching resources provide great support for Open Science instructors and trainers. The Open Science training handbook will be a key resource and a first step towards developing Open Access and Open Science curricula and andragogies. Supporting and connecting an emerging Open Science community that wishes to pass on their knowledge as multipliers, the handbook will enrich training activities and unlock the community’s full potential.

In this first release of the Open Science Training Handbook, some initial feedback from the community is already included.},

The focus of the report is on options for deploying standards established for OER (Open Educational Resources). It aims to help DCC and the FAIRsFAIR project consider options for creating a minimal metadata application profile for learning resources. This profile would be piloted in collaboration with related projects that seek to contribute towards development of a shared catalogue of such resources, particularly of training materials. The context is a trial exchange of metadata between the FAIRsFAIR project and catalogues provided by related projects. These projects have shared interests in providing seamless discovery of learning resources through the European Open Science Cloud. The contents will inform later work including FAIRsFAIR D6.3.},

	abstract = {Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remain significant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG). The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.},

            There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
