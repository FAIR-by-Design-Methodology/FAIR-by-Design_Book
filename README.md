# Methodology for FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials GitBook

## About

This is a living document version of the [Skills4EOSC D2.2 Methodology for FAIR-by-Design Training Materials](https://zenodo.org/record/7875541) that provides the most current version of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. The GitBook is going to be continuously improved during the Skills4EOSC project lifetime based on the gathered feedback from training and dissemination events as well as the [FAIR-by-Design Methodology Open Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/FAIR-by-Design_Open_Survey).

### Abstract

This document describes a methodology for FAIR-by-design production of learning materials based on the backward instructional process that is extended with additional activities focusing on the implementation of the FAIR guiding principles. A general discussion on important aspect of implementation such as granularity, scope, metadata schema, interoperability and publication in relevant repositories is provided together with a step by step six stage workflow and checklists that help implement the FAIR-by-design process. The outlined methodology will be used as a blueprint for a train-the-trainer course aiming to present the practical FAIR-by-design instructional design.

### Training

If you are looking for training materials related to the practical implementation of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology access the [FAIR-by-Design Methodology Training of Trainers learning content](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/).
